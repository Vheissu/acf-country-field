## About
This plugin allows you to have a country, city and if you select US as your country in the backend you get a states dropdown as well. Everything is autopopulating and concise, allowing for you to use it for numerous purposes including contact forms, order forms, registration forms and for creating your own classifieds websites.

The plugin in its current state works, but it might be buggy and missing some features as it was created in about an hour or so.
